If find is set to print files that are strictly younger than 2 days (-mtime
-2), it will instead print files that are exactly 2 days old. The function
get_comp_type actually increments the argument pointer timearg (parser.c:3175).
So, when the function is called the first time (parser.c:3109), timearg still
points to ’-’. However, when it is called the second time (parser.c:3038),
timearg already points to ’2’ such that it is incorrectly classified as COMP_EQ
(parser.c:3178).

Examples of Correct Fixes: 

1) Save timearg in auxiliary variable and restore after first call to
get_comp_type.

2) Pass a copy of timearg into the first call of get_comp_type. 

3) Pass a copy of timearg into get relative timestamp (which calls
get_comp_type the second time). 

4) Decrement timearg after the first call to get_comp_type. 

Example of Incorrect Fix:
Restore timearg only if classified as COMP_LT (Incomplete Fix because it does
not solve the problem for -mtime +2).
