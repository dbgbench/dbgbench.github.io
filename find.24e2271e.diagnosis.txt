If find is set to print the found file’s base directory followed by the found
file’s name (-printf ’%H %P\n’) and there exist directories of different
length, then find incorrectly splits base directory and file name during
printing. Because the index state.starting_path is set only for the first
working directory (ftsfind.c:278-279) the incorrect value of
state.starting_path is used when printing base directory and file name
(pred.c:709-718, pred.c:813). 

Examples of Correct Fixes:
1) Recompute state.starting_path length for each argv before calling find.
2) Weaken condition that prevents state.starting_path_length to be reset. 

Example of Incorrect Fix: 
Always update state.starting_path_length even if ent->fts level != 0
(Regression because it then carries the incorrect ”starting_path_length”).
