If find is set to print all files that are exactly 2 days old (-mtime 2), it
crashes with a segmentation fault. Variable **pend is defined as pointer
pointer (parser.c:2739) and expected to be allocated when xstrtoumax is called
(parser.c:2759). However, it is still NULL after the call such that the null
pointer check for pend* is itself a null pointer dereference (parser.c:2762). 

Examples of Correct Fixes:
1) Add null pointer check for pend.
2) Change definition of **pend to *pend and update references.
3) Allocate memory for **pend.

Examples of Incorrect Fixes: 
1) Remove code containing null pointer dereference (Treating the Symptom). 
2) Change the check involving **pend (Treating the Symptom because the
nullpointer is still dereferenced, only the program does not crash).
