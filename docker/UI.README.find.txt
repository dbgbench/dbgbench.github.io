Make sure to set up the infrastructure and your favorite debuggers ahead of the study!
* First, follow instructions on 'installation and setup'
* Check whether your debugging tool or IDE works with our source code!
* Check whether the links to the questionnaires work (/root/Desktop/find*/readme.txt).

HOW TO ACCESS THE DESKTOP
* Install VNC Viewer: https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/
** Execute './run.sh find'
** Note down the VNC Viewer address.
** Install editors: 'apt-get update; apt-get install -y gedit; wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TCattd/sublime-text-linux-installer/master/st3install && chmod +x st3install && ./st3install'
** Start VNC Viewer from your Desktop 
** Use the VNC Viewer address from './run.sh find' 
** Password: corebench
_______________
TROUBLESHOOTING
* If you cannot connect to VNCViewer, run on host: 'docker inspect debugstudy0 | grep IPAddress', add port 5900
* If you get "Error response from daemon: Conflict" run 'docker restart debugstudy0'
* If you installed Docker on an Ubuntu Host and cannot set breakpoints,
** Copy sources and binaries to the HOST machine:
mkdir source
for i in $(seq 1 14); do docker cp debugstudy0:/root/Desktop/find$i source; done
* If you have other images running when switching between subjects, execute "docker images" to
obtain the ids of all images, find which "debugstudy" or "debug/grep" images that may need 
to be removed.

HOW TO INSTALL ECLIPSE IDE
* Install Java: apt-get update; apt-get install -y default-jre
* Download Eclipse: https://eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/mars/1/eclipse-cpp-mars-1-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
* Unzip Eclipse: tar -zxvf eclipse-cpp-mars-1-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
* Open Eclipse and choose 'Import from Makefile' for any one error.
* Check out: http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Fcdt_t_debug_exes.htm

DEBUGGING
* Find buggy binary in /root/Desktop/find*/find/find/find
* Find buggy source in /root/Desktop/find*/find/find/*.c
* Find link to questionaire and instructions in /root/Desktop/find*/readme.txt
* EACH ERROR HAS ITS OWN LINK!
* Solve at least 11 of 14 bugs in total 8 hours.

* Write down the time, you spend debugging each error! 
* If you can't figure it out, you can pause for this error, go to another one, and resume later.
* We suggest to use the debugger to step through the buggy execution and understand the source code.
* We suggest to fix the 4 segmentation faults first
* Most bugs can be localized in parser.c, ftsfind.c, pred.c, find.c, and exec.c
