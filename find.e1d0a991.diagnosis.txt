If find is set to a directory containing a file, to follow symbolic links (-L), and to execute ls for every subdirectory (-execdir ls ’{}’ \;),
then find incorrectly also prints the base directory. If find is set to follow symlinks, the flag FTS_LOGICAL is set (ftsfind.c:349)
before the directory search is initiated (ftsfind.c:364). When a directory is searched (ftsfind.c:373), the working directory
is not changed because FTS_LOGICAL is set. Hence, the *full* pathname is passed as argument to execdir (pred.c:484-490 and
pred.c:467-471). Example of Correct Fix: Correctly compute pathname and prefix in new_impl_pred_exec. Example of Incorrect
Fix: Remove FTS_LOGICAL flag (Incorrect Workaround because FTS_LOGICAL is supposed to be set).
