If find is set to search for files (-type f) while following symbolic links
(-L) and a symbolic link loop exists, then it aborts with a coredump instead of
listing the symbolic links and terminating gracefully. If a symbolic link loop
exists, no stat information is available and the flag FTS_NS is set
(ftsfind:584). The flag is not properly handled (ftsfind.c:425-446), such that
state.type and mode are incorrectly set (ftsfind.c:460) and the assertion fails
(pred.c:1578). 

Example of Correct Fix:
1) Handle FTS_NS flag. 

Examples of Incorrect Fixes: 
1) Remove violated assertion (Treating the Symptom).
2) Force stat() to be called such that stat information is available
(Incorrect Workaround because stat() is not supposed to be called on 
symlink loops).
